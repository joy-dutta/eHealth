## Preparation of Synthetic IoMT Data for Cardiac Arrest
In today’s world, data is the new fuel for any discipline. To the best of the author's knowledge, in eHealth, the availability of IoMT data that helps researchers train their AI models for the prediction of cardiac arrest is not readily available. A free and readily available dataset is the first and foremost thing that is necessary to explore any specific domain. To make up for this fact, this article does a substantial amount of research in this area to come up with a synthesized dataset that researchers in the eHealth field can use to test their AI/ML model. For this purpose, we have chosen a specific medical condition, "cardiac arrest," for which we are preparing synthesized IoMT data. This article will provide all valid ranges of medical sensors (IoMT) in different situations for a subject (patient). The provided range is based on the information published in peer-reviewed journals and articles that has been proofread by well-established practitioners in this medical field and can be utilized to generate any size of the synthetic dataset for cardiac arrest according to the researcher’s requirements.
